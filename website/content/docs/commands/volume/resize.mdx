# Command: volume resize

The `volume resize` command resizes external storage volumes with Nomad's
[Container Storage Interface (CSI)][csi] support. Not all CSI plugins support
this command. Some plugins only support offline resize. If a volume that does
not support online resize is currently claimed, the `volume resize` command
will return an error.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad volume resize [options] [volume] [size]
```

The `volume resize` command requires two arguments, specifying the ID of
volume and the new size. The size argument accepts human-friendly suffixes
such as `"100GiB"`. The volume must be [registered] with Nomad in order to be
resized. Resizing will fail if the volume is still in use by an allocation or
in the process of being unpublished, if the plugin does not support online
resize. CSI does not currently support reducing the size of volumes.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the
`csi-write-volume` capability for the volume's namespace.
