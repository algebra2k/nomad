# Command: volume resize

The `volume resize` command resizes external storage volumes with Nomad's
[Container Storage Interface (CSI)][csi] support. Not all CSI plugins support
this command. Some plugins only support offline resize. If a volume that does
not support online resize is currently claimed, the `volume resize` command
will return an error.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad volume resize [options] [volume] [-min size] [-max size]
```

The `volume resize` command requires one argument specifying the ID of the
volume, and at least one option specifying the new new. The volume must be
[registered] with Nomad in order to be resized. Resizing will fail if the
volume is still in use by an allocation or in the process of being
unpublished, if the plugin does not support online resize. CSI does not
currently support reducing the size of volumes.

When ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the
`csi-write-volume` capability for the volume's namespace.

## General Options

@include 'general_options.mdx'

## Resize Options

- `-min` `(string: <optional>)` - Option for setting the capacity. The new
  volume size must be at least this large, in bytes. The storage provider may
  return a volume that is larger than this value. Accepts human-friendly
  suffixes such as `"100GiB"`.

- `-max` `(string: <optional>)` - Option for setting the capacity. The volume
  must be no more than this large, in bytes. The storage provider may return a
  volume that is smaller than this value. Accepts human-friendly suffixes such
  as `"100GiB"`.
